# Family Reunification Data Visualization

This portfolio project focuses on the critical issue of Family Reunification for Unaccompanied Minors living in Turkey and uses data visualization to tell stories and present complex data in an engaging, informative, and visually appealing manner.

## Project Overview

This project uses data from a report by the Refugee Solidarity Network to create an data-driven storytelling web page. My goal was to make the information accessible to a broad audience, allowing users to understand the challenges and processes involved in family reunification for unaccompanied minors.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Utilizing libraries like `@nivo` and `react-simple-maps`, I created a variety of interactive charts and maps that help to communicate the data points key to the report's findings.

- **Interactive UI with XState**: I used `XState` to create an `ApplicationStepper` component, which guides users through the non-linear stages of applying for family reunification.

- **Responsive Design**: I ensured that all visualizations and components are responsive, providing a quality user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React and TypeScript for building the user interface and ensuring type safety.
- XState for managing the complex logic of the `ApplicationStepper` component.
- Data visualization libraries (`@nivo`, `react-simple-maps`) for creating interactive charts and maps.
- Tailwind CSS for styling and animations to make the application visually appealing.
